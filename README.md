### What's in this repo?

#### Team Draft Data
  This folder contains all the CSV files for each team's draft data since 1989.

#### combined_draft_data
  This folder has 2 CSV files that display pick success for each draft pick, based on the Z-Score methodology and Percentile methodology respectively.

#### static
  In here, you will see the images folder which contains the sorted and unsorted plots of all the team's successful pick percentages. Outside of the images folder, you will find the code used to plot these graphs.

#### Root Directory
  The 'app.py' file was used to render the HTML for our project dashboard, and the code for that was subsequently stored in 'index.html'. The 'percentileSD.py' file is the Python code we ran to determine successful
  draft picks based on our percentile methodology. The 'zScore.py' file serves the same purpose but instead is used in accordance with our Z-Score methodology.
