                <p class="card-text">
                    Hi! We're Pushpesh and Atai. As avid OKC Thunder fans, we have watched our team reach great successes through adding talent
                    from the NBA Draft, which allows teams to select exciting young players each year following the season. Seeing how teams can 
                    flourish by drafting well, we became curious on which teams were the 'best' at drafting. And using data, we decided to figure it out!
                    <br> </br>
                    To determine successful draft picks, we first compiled draft data from various teams by reading multiple CSV files containing each team's draft data
                    and adding a team identifier to each dataset. After reading these files into their respective DataFrames, we then merged these datasets into a single comprehensive DataFrame. 
                    When cleaning the data, here are some parameters that we established:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only consider draft data since 1989, when the 2-round draft system was established. Previous draft years led to many draft picks 
                            having no recorded stats or metrics</li>
                        <li>Ensure all relevant metrics being used were numeric</li>   
                        <li>Remove any rows containing missing values</li> 
                    </ul>
                    The key metrics we considered were VORP (Value over Replacement Player), BPM (Box Plus-Minus), and WS (Win Shares). 
                    Using these metrics, we created two different methodologies to determine draft success as 
                    displayed below:

        <!-- Z-Score Methodology -->

            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">Methodology #1: Z-Score Methodology</h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                    We calculated z-scores for these metrics within each draft year and draft position to normalize the 
                    performance data. Weighted scores were then computed for each player based on these z-scores, 
                    with specific weights assigned to each metric and z-score category. A threshold was set for determining success, 
                    with players whose weighted scores exceeded 0.7 deemed successful draft picks. Finally, we identified and listed the 
                    successful picks, dividing each team's successful picks by their total draft picks, and plotting this success percentage.

                <p class="card-text">Our project yielded several interesting findings. Our inner OKC superfans were validated, 
                    as in both techniques, we saw that our Thunder placed top 2 in successful pick percentage (SPP). 
                    In fact, we were happy to see that the top 5 teams by SPP computed using each of our methods respectively were composed of 
                    nearly the exact same teams. By having two measures of SPP that both yielded nearly the same results, 
                    we were able to confirm that there did not seem to be too much variability in the results, strengthening each individual finding. 
                    We hope to look upon our SPP graphs leading up to each annual NBA Draft as we use our custom tool to make informed predictions on the success of future NBA Draft picks.</p>
